                access to the data, as well as the access, input, forwarding, ensuring availability and their separation. Furthermore, we have 
                set up procedures that ensure that data subjects' rights are exercised, that data are deleted and that data are responded to at

                required to fulfill the contract), you have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate

                takes place, for example, on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a data 
                protection level corresponding to the EU (e.g. for the USA through the <span class="font-medium text-slate-900">“Privacy Shield”</span>) or compliance with officially
